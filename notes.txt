    - mcmc x parameter should take an array, should default to all x simultaneously
    - mcmc should always include x being infinity
- Also:
    - Development of P(h) over sample size.
        - with uncertainty
        - curve fitting


TODO: How can P(h) = a - b/n be possible? seems to be way to fast-growing towards asymptote.
    With these restraints: 1 >= a >= b >= 0, if that is true how
        Because 1 >= a >= 0 and b >= 0
        and b gotta be smaller than a because for n=1 prob should still be >= 0.
            This last one is not implemented in the code (and I think thats good).
